             Hello, I'm current enroll in web development course in Houston,TX. This is our first home work assignment.
             Well let tell you a little bit about my background before this couse.
            </p>
            Most of my career is in the oil field industry with Halliburton. I spend 12 years as Measuring While Drilling (MWD) in the oil field, they would nick name us MWD
            as "movie watching dude" because some would watch movie while monitoring the drilling. But in reality , it is a physical and mentally challenge work. You have deal with the enviroment because you alot of time you will be working outside. Also you have to be prepare for  if something would go wrong like that one time when we have to abandon ship because of well blow out.

            <p>After 12 years in the oil field , I have the opportunity to work in the office as a software tester. There I test a software that we were used in the oil field with our drilling tool.
                I also get to test new and enhance feature that add to the software. We test the software according Agile methology where you would break down the new feature to smaller user stories. With smaller user's story the task is easier to manage. 
            </p>
               In my spare time, I like to upgrade my PC or build a new one and benchmark it. My last project was adding water cooling with clear water tubing. Also I play Diablo 3 from time to time.
